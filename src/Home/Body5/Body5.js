            <h1>Why Should Kids and Teens Learn to Code with </h1>
            <h1>Tynker?</h1>
            <p>
                Because <b>technology is so integrated</b>  into virtually every aspect of our lives,
                learning about it is <b>more important than ever.</b>  Our coding platform makes it
                convenient and fun for kids and teens to gain knowledge that will serve them
                well throughout their lives. You can count on our<b>trusted
                    methods</b>  to help them develop and grow their capabilities with computers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tynker isn't just for schools and coding camps, though. Parents who value
                <b>STEM education</b> and want their children to know how to code should know that
                our kids programming platform can be used at home, too. Tynker offers a range
                of solutions with icon-coding for pre-readers, block-based coding, and advanced
                courses in Python, JavaScript, data science, art, and image processing. There are
                individual and family home plans, and our online coding classes for all ages are
                an excellent way for them to gain the supplemental STEM skills needed for their future.
